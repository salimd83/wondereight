        A facility where we give talks and trainings to visitors, covering subjects from our work experience.
        It also hosts guest speakers and tutors, with access to all the building’s facilities.
        The E/Room programs are open for all applicants and are constantly updated on our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re proud to say that the E/Room is the first room to use <a target="_blank" href="http://cedarenv.com">Cedarenv.com‘s Eco-Board®</a> and is mostly
        built from recycled and recuperated material (42 eco-boards equivalent to 153,972 supermarket plastic bags).
        The roof also collects rainwater in tanks, with which we water our garden.
